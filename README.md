# Sheepshead #

Sheepshead is a client-server implementation of a German-American card game
played mostly in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Outside of this geographic
region, few people seem to recognize it.

The rules can be read at [Pagat](http://www.pagat.com/schafk/shep.html).

This game is still in its very, very early infancy. The long term aim is for many different clients and bots to connect to a simple TCP-based server and play a challenging, friendly game.

The codebase itself is developed using literate programming and the SpiralWeb LP system. You will need this to hack on the code.
