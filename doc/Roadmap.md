# Sheepshead Roadmap #

Sheepshead will be developed iteratively, inasmuch as it is developed at all.
The initial version will be lacking many of the features that will be desired in
the long term.

## Version 0.1 ##

This first release will have only the most basic of groundwork laid for the
remaining work. 

This version will have two components, a vanilla game server containing no AI or
authentication, and a simple command line application.

This game should be network playable with multiple clients connecting to the
game server, but will not be more than an automated way for human beings to play
cards with a text interface.

The text-based client will not write out any files or save any state, including
preferences.
